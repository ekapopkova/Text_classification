    "Интернет-магазин «Викишоп» запускает новый сервис. Теперь пользователи могут редактировать и дополнять описания товаров, как в вики-сообществах. То есть клиенты предлагают свои правки и комментируют изменения других. Магазину нужен инструмент, который будет искать токсичные комментарии и отправлять их на модерацию. \n",

Подберем гиперпараметры для модлей. Так как на лицо дисбаланс классов, будем использовать в обоих моделях параметр - class_weight = 'balanced'. Подбор гиперпараметров и стратегии векторизации будем производить с помощью optuna. Метрика качества - F1."
